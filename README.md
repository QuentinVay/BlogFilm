# FanBlog of Films

Welcome to our FanBlog of Films project! This website was created in just two days by Quentin, Marcelo, and Adrien after learning React in one week. Our goal was to put our newly acquired knowledge to use and develop a website for film enthusiasts where we could share our favorite movies, rate them, and provide summaries and descriptions.

## Objective

Our primary goal was to create an interactive and user-friendly website for film lovers. We aimed to offer an experience where users could explore a selection of our favorite films, sort them by categories, perform searches, and learn more about each movie through detailed summaries and descriptions.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: We chose React for its efficiency and ability to create interactive user interfaces.
- **HTML/CSS**: These languages are essential for structuring and styling our website.
- **JavaScript**: JavaScript was used to add dynamic features to the site.

## Key Features

- **Movie Listing**: You'll find a list of our favorite movies here, with detailed information including summaries, ratings, and descriptions.
- **Search Filters**: Easily search for movies by title, category, or rating.
- **Categories**: Movies are organized into categories for simplified navigation.
